## Project Goals
I built this project to enhance my **JavaScript** skills and apply my knowledge of **HTML** and **CSS** in a practical, interactive way. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- Event handling and user interactions.
- Applying CSS for styling and responsive design.
- Implementing game logic and conditions for victory and game restart.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game board will appear with 9 empty cells.
3. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns clicking on the cells to place their marks.
4. The game will automatically detect if a player has won.
5. After a win, click the **"New Game"** button to restart the game and play again.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for the basic structure of the game board.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game and making it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the game logic, handling player moves, checking for wins, and resetting the game.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the project:
   ```bash
